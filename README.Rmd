# MNE-R: fast acccess to MNE-Python from within R

<img src="man/figures/mne_logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="160" />

The [MNE-Python](https://mne-tools.github.io/stable/index.html) project provides a full tool stack for processing and visualizing electrophysiology data. That is, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography but also intracranial EEG.
[MNE-R](https://mne-tools.github.io/mne-r/index.html) facilitates integrating this mature and extensive functionality into R-based data processing, visualization and statisticasl modeling.
This is made possible through the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package, which enables seamless integration of Python into R.

Currently, MNE-R is focussing on documenting how to use MNE-Python through R, based on familiar [MNE-examples](https://mne-tools.github.io/stable/auto_examples/index.html) while also showcasing what R can add to the game in terms of statistics and visualization functionality.

In the future, more R-functions may be added that facilitate the interaction with MNE-Python or implement complementary functionality.

The project is open to contributions.

## Getting Started

In order to use MNE-R, MNE-Python has to be installed with all its dependencies. Some configuration may be needed to make sure `reticulate` knows which Python installation to use. Please consider the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/calling_python.html) and the [MNE](https://mne-tools.github.io/stable/getting_started.html) documentation. We generally recommend using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) Python distribution and Python 3 instead of Python 2.

For seamlessly combining R and Python code in one Rmarkdown script, the latest [Rstudio 1.2](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/04/30/rstudio-1-2-release/) is needed.

Currently, MNE-R can be installed from github.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("mne-tools/mne-r")
```


To get started, simply load the mne library

```{r}
library(mne)  # load mne and get the mne object

# the mne object wraps the loaded mne module inside Python
print(names(mne)[1:10])

# use dollar signs to access MNE modules, functions and objects
cat(mne$datasets$sample$data_path$`__doc__`)
```
## Troubleshooting and known issues.

- If knitting Python chunks inside Rmarkdown fails, it is most likely a problem of telling ```reticulate``` which Python interpreter to use. To use the recommended Python 3 from Aanaconda, assuming it is installed, you can include this line in your `.bashrc` (Linux) or `.bash_profile` (Mac):

```bash
export RETICULATE_PYTHON=$HOME/anaconda3/bin/python
```
- Also make sure your Python installation is ok. If you cannot run the Python code of interest using the Python interpreter, the problem is there. For exampple, make sure that inside the Python interpreter importing ```mne``` works.

```Python
import mne
```
This should not give you any error message.

- For optimal Python and ```reticulate``` support in Rstudio, make sure you have the latest version of [Rstudio](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/04/30/rstudio-1-2-release/).

- Currently, when making matplotlib figures from within R, the resulting image will not be rendered inside the Rstudio Rmarkdown chunk.
You will need to save, load and display the figure or explicitly, write Python code in a Python chunk, or explicitly make maptlotlib open a window:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(mne)
plt <- import("matplotlib.pyplot")  # get matplotlib handle

data_path <- mne$datasets$sample$data_path()
raw_fname <- paste(data_path,
                   'MEG',
                   'samlpe',
                   'sample_audvis_filt-0-40_raw.fif',
                   sep = '/')
raw <- mne$io$read_raw_fif(raw_fname)
raw$plot()  # plot it!
plt$show()  # show the figure, then search for the window popping up.
```

- Some of the examples may depend on the latest MNE-Python code. We will try to provide patches little by little in MNE-Python or here.

- Currently, if 32-bit and 64-bit versions of R are installed, it seems devtools tries to build for both of them. This yields a ```loading failed for 'i386'``` error. To force building the package for your currently running R version use the ```INSTALL_opts``` argument of ```install_github```:

``` r
devtools::install_github("mne-tools/mne-r", INSTALL_opts=c("--no-multiarch"))
```
## Roadmap

1. Add many vignettes and examples
2. Find common inconvenient steps and add convenience R functions
3. Motivate contributed examples and code from the R-EEG community
4. Add advanced content that leverages functionality unique to R
